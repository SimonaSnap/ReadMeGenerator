## Instillation 
The user needs to have Node installed on their computer and then they can clone this repository and start using it either in their terminal or on a program like VS Code
## Usage 
Once Node is installed and the repository is cloned, the user may open up the application in VS Code. Once open they would open index.js integrated terminal and would type node index.js to start. Afterwards they would answer the questions they are prompted in the terminal to create the user.md file that would be the generated ReadMe file. In regards to the screenshots, the user can set up custom alt text in the questions, but they would need to set up the readme in their final repository and change the screenshot link found on line 129 of the generateMarkdown.js file to get their own screenshot to load. In addition, the user can continue to add to that template literal to add more screenshots to the Readme if they want.
